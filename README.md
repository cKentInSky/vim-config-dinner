(: vim config :)

for those who aren't familiar...

on most systems (for instance, osx, linux etc...) the vim editor checks the ~ directory for a .vimrc file (looks for ~/.vimrc), so just cp the file VIMRC as .vimrc to ~ directory.

after that, copy the vim-config-dinner directory to ~ as ~/.vim

woohoo!
